Installing Tatoeba
------------------

### Linux & Mac

To install Tatoeba on your machine, we recommend that you use [Imouto][2]. 
Simply follow the instructions in [Imouto for development][3] in the README.

If for some reason you prefer to install manually or if Imouto doesn't work 
for you, you can follow our [wiki article about installing Tatoeba][4].

### Windows

If you are a Windows user, you won't be able to use Imouto. You will have to 
install everything manually. Please refer to our [wiki article about installing
Tatoeba][4].
