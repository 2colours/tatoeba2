New developer
-------------

If you are interested in contributing to this project as a developer, please read the 
[guide for new developers](http://en.wiki.tatoeba.org/articles/show/guide-for-new-developers#)
before you start coding anything.



Installing Tatoeba
------------------
To install Tatoeba on your machine, we recommend that you use 
[IMOUTO](https://github.com/Tatoeba/admin). Simply follow the instructions in 
[imouto for development](https://github.com/Tatoeba/admin/blob/master/README.md#imouto-for-development) 
in the README. This will not work for Windows users though.

If you are a Windows user, you can maybe try to figure out something that works
for you from the following articles in the Wiki.

[Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/tatoebaproject).

Note

This readme is still in progress. Feel free to add any information that you find would be useful. 
The final goal is to gather here all the information needed for people to get involved in Tatoeba's 
code as smoothly as possible.
