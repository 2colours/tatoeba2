Tatoeba
#######

Tatoeba is a libre/free database of example sentences translated into many 
languages. Our goal is to create a resource for people studying 
languages—either to learn or research. The database is currently used:

As a source of example sentences by free dictionaries and language 
learning websites (like Jim Breen’s WWWJDIC; Jim Breen is actually a 
member too):

- There's a list of free dictionary and language learning websites using
  Tatoeba's corpus maintained by our member CK:

- As a rich resource for language learners: They can find out how to use words
  or how to translate grammatical constructs and idioms.

- For research: example papers include:

    * Research on treebanking Japanese (Francis Bond, 栗林 孝行 [Takayuki
      Kuribayashi], 橋本 力 [Hashimoto Chikara] (2008)
      HPSGに基づくフリーな日本語ツリー バンクの構築 [A free Japanese Treebank
      based on HPSG]. In 14th Annual Meeting of The Association for Natural
      Language Processing, Tokyo),

    * Statistical machine translation (Eric Nichols, Francis Bond, Darren Scott
      Appling and Yuji Matsumoto (2010) Paraphrasing Training Data for
      Statistical Machine Translation. Journal of Natural Language Processing,
      17(3), pages 101-122)


The main site currently has about 1 million page views and 250 thousands unique
visitors monthly, as reported by Google Analytics, and the corpus is growing
steadily by 3% or more every month.
